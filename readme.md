# LinkShort - Containerised URL shortener

This is the Python code and Docker/Kubernetes configuration for a link shortening web app

**This is not a functional application yet:**

> I will make a full release on this repo when it is in a secure, working state

I am using this to learn:
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Python web app development
- DevSecOps automation

## Testing locally

- Create a file in the root directory, next to the `docker-compose.yaml` file, called `.env`, with the following contents, customising the values between **<>** with your own substitutions:
```txt
USER=default
MASTER=<a-super-strong-password>
REPLICA=<a-different-super-strong-password>
```

### Docker compose
- From root directory of repo, run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up --detach --scale redis-master=1 --scale redis-replica=3
```
```bash
[+] Running (6/6)
 ✔ Container linkshort-app-1
 ✔ Container linkshort-redis-replica-2
 ✔ Container linkshort-redis-replica-3
 ✔ Container linkshort-redis-replica-1
 ✔ Container linkshort-redis-master-1
 ✔ Network linkshort_ls-net
```

- If succesful, app will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), with a redis master database with 3 replica nodes.

- To shut down the service, run this command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
