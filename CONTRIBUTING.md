# Contributing to the LinkShort project

## Project Objectives

- This is a Python Flask app that shortens URLs and re-directs users that go to the shortened URLs.
- It uses Docker/Kubernetes to host the databases and web services that serve web clients.
- The repository itself is intended to test the capabiltiies of DevSecOps automation tooling.
- If there are any exploitable vulnerabilities that have a patch available, they will be applied.
- Usage and/or contribution to this project must be done under the terms in the `LICENSE` file.

- Any offensive or abusive language in tickets will result in a closure of the issue, and a ban from this repository for the offending user
- Any impatience will only waste yours and the code owners time, do not expect any rigid response times for issues raised.
> Any community based support given must be in adherance to the rules written in the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file
- Breaches of this behaviour will not be tolerated, and will result in a ban from this repository for the offending user
